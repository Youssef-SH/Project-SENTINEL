# **Project SENTINEL - AI-Driven Disaster Prediction Platform**

## Overview

**Project SENTINEL** (Safety Environmental Network for Threat Identification, Notification, and Emergency Logistics) is an AI-driven disaster prediction and alerting platform designed to enhance public safety and disaster response. SENTINEL integrates machine learning models with community-verified data to predict and respond proactively to environmental threats such as wildfires and floods. The platform provides valuable, real-time insights to authorities and residents in high-risk areas, enabling them to take swift action to mitigate potential disasters.

The core components of SENTINEL are:
- **Wildfire Prediction Model**: Predicts wildfire occurrence and severity in California using historical wildfire data and climate information.
- **Flood Prediction Model**: A forthcoming model to predict flood risk based on weather, geographic, and community data.
- **Community Engagement and Alert System**: Integrates public input to enhance model accuracy and facilitate efficient emergency response.

## Unique Value Proposition

**"Predict. Notify. Protect—Together."**

Project SENTINEL provides real-time disaster alerts with 88% accuracy, aiming for 92-95% by integrating additional data sources. Verified community alerts empower local authorities and residents, establishing SENTINEL as a proactive solution for reliable disaster resilience and preparedness.

## Goals and Objectives

The goal of Project SENTINEL is to harness the power of AI to predict, alert, and prevent environmental disasters. The key objectives are:
1. **Predict Wildfires and Floods**: Use predictive analytics and machine learning to anticipate when and where environmental disasters will occur.
2. **Empower Authorities**: Provide local governments and emergency response agencies with real-time alerts and insights to improve disaster preparedness and resource allocation.
3. **Engage Communities**: Incorporate community-verified data into the prediction models to enhance accuracy, encourage public involvement, and improve response effectiveness.

## Key Features

- **AI Prediction Models**: Predicts wildfires and floods using advanced AI with high accuracy.
- **Automated SOS Alerts**: Collects and prioritizes emergency signals from social media.
- **Community Engagement**: Gamified reward system encourages users to report accurate incidents, improving the data quality and fostering community involvement.
- **Data Fusion**: Unique blend of AI-driven predictions and community input for hyper-local accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable across regions and disaster types, making SENTINEL a comprehensive global solution.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Wildfire and Climate Data**:
   - Collected from public sources, such as government databases and weather stations.
   - Preprocessed to remove irrelevant or incomplete records, and mapped wildfire occurrences to corresponding weather data for a unified dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted relevant features, including temperature, precipitation, and fire size.
   - Used one-hot encoding for categorical data (e.g., locations) and cyclical encoding for temporal features (e.g., month).

### Model Development

#### Wildfire Prediction Model
- **Classification Task**: Uses a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** to predict whether a wildfire will occur in a specific location and time.
- **Regression Task**: Predicts the area affected by wildfires using a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (currently under development).
- **Model Explainability**: Employed **SHAP** to interpret feature importance and provide transparency regarding the key factors influencing predictions.

#### Flood Prediction Model (Under Construction)
- Will leverage historical flood data and climate conditions to predict flood risk and impact.

### Community Engagement
- **Community Alerts**: Integrates community-reported incidents through social media and other platforms to validate and supplement model predictions.
- **Gamification**: A badge reward system will encourage community members to contribute data, ensuring sustained engagement.

## High-Level Concept

**"SENTINEL: The Waze for Disaster Alerts"** — A comprehensive, AI-powered, community-driven platform for real-time wildfire and flood alerts, revolutionizing preparedness and emergency response for both authorities and local communities.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Emergency agencies, municipalities, and fire departments needing precise real-time data to optimize response times and resource allocation.
- **Secondary**: Residents in high-risk areas, insurance companies looking for accurate risk assessments, and NGOs focused on climate resilience and advocacy.

## Key Metrics

- **Prediction Accuracy**: Improve model accuracy to achieve 92-95%.
- **Response Time Reduction**: Target an impressive 40% reduction in response times.
- **User Growth**: Aim to reach 25,000 active users within 18 months.
- **Data Validation**: Increase verified incident reports by an estimated 30%.

## Channels

- **Mobile & Web App**: Real-time alerts and reporting for residents.
- **Dashboard for Authorities**: Centralized data for emergency response.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborations with government agencies and NGOs.

## Revenue Model

- **Premium Subscription Plans**: For alerts and in-depth insights targeted to residents in high-risk zones.
- **Risk Data Licensing**: Insights tailored and sold to insurance companies for effective risk management.
- **Government Solutions**: Customizable dashboards and analytics for government and municipal agencies, supporting disaster preparedness and emergency response.

## Project Status

**Current Status**: The Wildfire Prediction Model is functional, and work on the Flood Prediction Model is ongoing. Community engagement features are being prototyped for integration.

## Future Plans

Project SENTINEL is an evolving platform, and we aim to:
1. **Complete the Flood Prediction Model** to provide similar insights for flood risks.
2. **Expand to Other Regions** beyond California to cover other high-risk areas.
3. **Integrate Real-Time Data Sources**, such as satellite imagery, to improve the accuracy and timeliness of predictions.
4. **Community Dashboard**: Create a user-friendly interface to display real-time alerts and allow community members to contribute data seamlessly.

## User Benefits

- **For Residents**: Early warnings, real-time disaster alerts, and access to preparedness tips.
- **For Authorities**: Improved disaster management with centralized alerts and accurate predictions.
- **For Insurance Companies**: Risk data insights for effective risk assessments and planning.
